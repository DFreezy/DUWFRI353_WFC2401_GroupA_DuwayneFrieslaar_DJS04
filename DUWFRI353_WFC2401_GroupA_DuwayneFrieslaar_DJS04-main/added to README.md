I found it alot more readable when dividing the code in their respective functions because that way I could space it out, and really explain it well. In terms of abstraction, I used objects and functions to structure the code nicely while maintaining functionality while ensuring that the next developer can add more to the document because of the clear documentation. I struggled a bit with placing the eventlisteners in the right place, but eventually I figure it out, and found a way to keep the functionality. I placed the addEventlisteners to the end of the document. This exercise showed me exactly how much I should still learn about learning.
